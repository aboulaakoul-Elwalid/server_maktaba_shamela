Over time, various schools of thought, or Madhabs, have emerged, each with its own methodologies and interpretations. The four major Sunni schools are Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali, while the two major Shia schools are Ja'fari and Zaidi. Here are the key differences between these schools:\n\n### Sunni Schools\n\n1. **Hanafi School**:\n   - **Founder**: Imam Abu Hanifa (d. 767 CE).\n   - **Methodology**: Emphasizes rationalism and analogy (qiyas). It is known for its flexibility and adaptability to changing circumstances.\n   - **Geographical Influence**: Predominant in Central Asia, South Asia, and parts of the Middle East.\n\n2. **Maliki School**:\n   - **Founder**: Imam Malik ibn Anas (d. 795 CE).\n   - **Methodology**: Relies heavily on the Hadith and the practices of the people of Medina. It is known for its emphasis on local customs and traditions.\n   - **Geographical Influence**: Predominant in North Africa, parts of West Africa, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n3. **Shafi'i School**:\n   - **Founder**: Imam Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i (d. 820 CE).\n   - **Methodology**: Combines elements of both the Hanafi and Maliki schools. It emphasizes the use of Hadith and analogy, but also considers the consensus of the community.\n   - **Geographical Influence**: Predominant in Egypt, parts of East Africa, and Southeast Asia.\n\n4. **Hanbali School**:\n   - **Founder**: Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855 CE).\n   - **Methodology**: Known for its strict adherence to the Hadith and the practices of the Prophet Muhammad. It is less flexible compared to other schools.\n   - **Geographical Influence**: Predominant in Saudi Arabia and parts of the Middle East.\n\n### Shia Schools\n\n1. **Ja'fari School**:\n   - **Founder**: Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (d. 765 CE).\n   - **Methodology**: Relies heavily on the teachings of the Imams, who are considered infallible leaders. It emphasizes the role of the Imam in interpreting Islamic law.\n   - **Geographical Influence**: Predominant among Shia Muslims in Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and other parts of the Middle East.\n\n2. **Zaidi School**:\n   - **Founder**: Zayd ibn Ali (d. 740 CE).\n   - **Methodology**: Similar to the Sunni schools in its reliance on the Quran, Hadith, and consensus, but it also recognizes the Imamate of Zayd ibn Ali and his descendants.\n   - **Geographical Influence**: Predominant in Yemen.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n- **Sources of Law**: While all schools recognize the Quran and Hadith as primary sources, they differ in the weight they give to consensus (ijma) and analogical reasoning (qiyas). Shia schools also place significant emphasis on the teachings of the Imams.\n- **Methodology**: The Hanafi school is known for its rationalism, the Maliki school for its emphasis on local customs, the Shafi'i school for its balanced approach, and the Hanbali school for its strict adherence to Hadith. Shia schools emphasize the role of the Imams in legal interpretation.\n- **Geographical Influence**: Each school has its own areas of predominance, reflecting historical, cultural, and political factors.\n\nThese differences highlight the rich diversity within Islamic jurisprudence, each school offering unique perspectives and methodologies for interpreting Islamic law.","message_id":"680bd29599ff165349db","message_type":"ai","timestamp":"2025-04-25T18:21:09.561067","conversation_id":"680bd27dea602479a63d","sources":[{"book_name":"أصول الفقه إجابة السائل شرح بغية الآمل","section_title":"الباب الثاني في الأدلة","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.819926262,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_758","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"أصول الفقه إجابة السائل شرح بغية الآمل","section_title":"الباب الثالث في المنطوق والمفهوم","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.809671342,"document_id":"6315_0_3_0_151","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"أصول الفقه إجابة السائل شرح بغية الآمل","section_title":"الباب الثاني في الأدلة","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.809653163,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_676","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"أصول الفقه إجابة السائل شرح بغية الآمل","section_title":"الباب الثاني في الأدلة","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.808362544,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_281","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"أصول الفقه إجابة السائل شرح بغية الآمل","section_title":"الباب الثاني في الأدلة","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.806216717,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_1029","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"}]}}
