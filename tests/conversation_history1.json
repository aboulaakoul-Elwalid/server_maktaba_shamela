It involves the interpretation and application of the principles and rules derived from the Quran and the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) to various aspects of life. Fiqh covers a wide range of topics, including worship, transactions, family law, criminal law, and more.\n\nThe study of Islamic jurisprudence is divided into several schools of thought, known as Madhabs. The most well-known Madhabs are:\n\n1. Hanafi: Founded by Imam Abu Hanifa, this school emphasizes reason and analogy in legal reasoning.\n2. Maliki: Established by Imam Malik ibn Anas, it is prevalent in North Africa and parts of West Africa.\n3. Shafi'i: Founded by Imam Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i, it is widely practiced in Southeast Asia and parts of the Middle East.\n4. Hanbali: Established by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, it is prevalent in Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf countries.\n5. Ja'fari: Followed by Shia Muslims, it is based on the teachings of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq.\n\nEach Madhab has its own methodology for deriving legal rulings, but they all share the common goal of interpreting Islamic law in a manner that is faithful to the Quran and Hadith.\n\nThe documents you mentioned, \"أصول الفقه إجابة السائل شرح بغية الآمل\" (Principles of Jurisprudence: Answering the Questioner, an Explanation of the Desired Goal), appear to be texts that delve into the principles and methodologies of Islamic jurisprudence. These texts would likely discuss the sources of Islamic law, the rules of interpretation, and the different approaches taken by various schools of thought within Islamic jurisprudence.","message_id":"680bd288e3c28d3c4b92","message_type":"ai","timestamp":"2025-04-25T18:20:56.891137","conversation_id":"680bd27dea602479a63d"}]
