There are four major schools of thought, or *madhabs*, in Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, each with its own methodologies and interpretations. Here are the key differences between them:\n\n1. **Hanbali School**:\n   - **Founder**: Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855 CE).\n   - **Methodology**: Emphasizes the use of *hadith* (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) and *ijma'* (consensus of the community) as primary sources of law. It is known for its literal interpretation of texts and less emphasis on *qiyas* (analogical reasoning).\n   - **Characteristics**: Often considered more conservative and literalist.\n\n2. **Shafi'i School**:\n   - **Founder**: Imam Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i (d. 820 CE).\n   - **Methodology**: Combines *hadith* and *qiyas*. Al-Shafi'i is known for systematizing *usul al-fiqh* (principles of jurisprudence) and for his work on the science of *hadith*.\n   - **Characteristics**: Balances between textual evidence and reasoning, making it widely accepted in various regions.\n\n3. **Maliki School**:\n   - **Founder**: Imam Malik ibn Anas (d. 795 CE).\n   - **Methodology**: Relies heavily on *hadith* and the practices of the people of Medina. It also considers *istihsan* (juristic preference) and *mursal hadith* (hadith with an interrupted chain).\n   - **Characteristics**: Known for its flexibility and consideration of local customs and practices.\n\n4. **Hanafi School**:\n   - **Founder**: Imam Abu Hanifa (d. 767 CE).\n   - **Methodology**: Places a strong emphasis on *qiyas* and *istihsan*. It is known for its rational and deductive approach, often considering the spirit of the law rather than the letter.\n   - **Characteristics**: Often considered more liberal and adaptable to changing circumstances.\n\n### Additional Schools of Thought\n\n- **Jafari School (Shia)**:\n  - **Founder**: Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (d. 765 CE).\n  - **Methodology**: Relies on the teachings of the Ahl al-Bayt (the family of the Prophet) and the concept of *taqiyah* (dissimulation). It also considers *ijma'* and *qiyas* but with a different interpretation.\n  - **Characteristics**: Emphasizes the role of the Imam in legal interpretation and the importance of the Ahl al-Bayt's teachings.\n\n- **Zaydi School (Shia)**:\n  - **Founder**: Imam Zayd ibn Ali (d. 740 CE).\n  - **Methodology**: Similar to the Hanafi school in its use of *qiyas* and *istihsan*, but with a strong emphasis on the teachings of Imam Zayd.\n  - **Characteristics**: Known for its flexibility and openness to different interpretations.\n\n- **Ibadi School**:\n  - **Founder**: Abd Allah ibn Ibad (d. 738 CE).\n  - **Methodology**: Emphasizes the Quran and *hadith* but with a strong focus on the principles of justice and equality.\n  - **Characteristics**: Known for its egalitarian principles and rejection of hereditary leadership.\n\nThese schools of thought have shaped the diverse landscape of Islamic jurisprudence, each contributing unique perspectives and methodologies to the understanding and application of Islamic law.","message_id":"67e486c586996e1efb44","message_type":"ai","timestamp":"2025-03-26T22:59:17.477437","conversation_id":"67e486afb54dd50b63d1","sources":[{"book_name":"أصول الفقه إجابة السائل شرح بغية الآمل","section_title":"الباب الثاني في الأدلة","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.819924,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_758","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"أصول الفقه إجابة السائل شرح بغية الآمل","section_title":"الباب الثالث في المنطوق والمفهوم","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.809794307,"document_id":"6315_0_3_0_151","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"أصول الفقه إجابة السائل شرح بغية الآمل","section_title":"الباب الثاني في الأدلة","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.809553564,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_676","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"أصول الفقه إجابة السائل شرح بغية الآمل","section_title":"الباب الثاني في الأدلة","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.808521688,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_281","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"أصول الفقه إجابة السائل شرح بغية الآمل","section_title":"الباب الثاني في الأدلة","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.806173,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_1029","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"}]}}
